# Plotly-Challenge
For this project, an interactive dashboard was built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset, whcich catalogs the microbes         that colonizes human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were         present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Steps Taken (1) - Plotly.js

1. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json.

2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

* Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

* Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

* Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

* Use otu_ids for the x values.

* Use sample_values for the y values.

* Use sample_values for the marker size.

* Use otu_ids for the marker colors.

* Use otu_labels for the text values.

4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

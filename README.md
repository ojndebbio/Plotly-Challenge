# Plotly-Challenge
For this project, an interactive dashboard was built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset, whcich catalogs the microbes         that colonizes human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were         present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
